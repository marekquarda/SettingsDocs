About Windows 11
Jerry Nixon, a senior software development engineer at Microsoft, stated that version 10 is the last one of Windows at the Ignite conference 2015. What he said convinced many that doing an upgrade is a wise decision at that time. Six years passed by, it is already 2021, Microsoft is going to issue the stable release of Windows 11 after publishing the insider preview build. What’s going on? Is it a business trick? I don’t know for sure but I think a complimentary upgrade offer for a newer version of Windows is quite attractive. However note that hardware specification for the new Windows is much higher than the old one. So the first thing you need to do is checking if your machine can handle it or not. Just go here to check out the minimum system requirements.

Experience on Windows 11

I have used Windows 11 on my desktop for two weeks. It seems they created a completely new user interface that is almost similar to Mac OS for version 10 then named it 11. We have centered taskbar items, new system icons and the start menu is also centered on the screen. The list of menu options that appeared in the context menu has changed compared to the previous version. The interface of Windows apps has been refreshed and the new layout makes it attractive. The new feature which has garnered the most media attention perhaps is the ability to run android apps on Windows. It means you can play your favorite mobile games on your PC without an additional emulator. But the pity is that I don’t see this feature in the current build so I haven’t had a chance to try it.

Should you upgrade your Windows to version 11
In general, Windows 11 includes many changes in the user interface. Its new features are cool but not ready, thus, they are not attractive enough to most Windows 10 users, especially those who need a stable system. I think you should wait for the major release before deciding whether to use it. However, if you just want to try the new Windows, just go for it, using a virtual machine is recommended in this case. You can get the iso file of Windows 11 here.

Activate Windows 11 using free KMS client key
The steps are completely similar to what I showed you in step-by-step instructions on how to activate Windows 10 for free, except that I do it on Windows 11 this time.

Step 1.2: Install KMS client key.

Use the command “slmgr /ipk kmsclientkey” to install a license key (kmsclientkey is the activation key that corresponds to your Windows edition).
The following is the list of Windows 11 Volume license keys.

Step 1.3: Set KMS server.
Use the command “slmgr /skms kms8.msguides.com” to connect to my KMS server.

 
run command slmgr skmsrun command slmgr skms
Step 1.4: Activate your Windows.
The last step is to activate your Windows using the command “slmgr /ato”.

run command slmgr atorun command slmgr ato
If you see the error 0x80070005, it means the server is busy. Please try the command “ato” again until you succeed.

Method 2: Using a batch file
This one is not recommended anymore due to the new update of Microsoft.

Step 2.1: Copy the code below into a new text document.
