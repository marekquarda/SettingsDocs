How to install Samba
The first thing we’ll do is install Samba. Log into your Linux server and issue the command:

sudo apt-get install samba -y
Start and enable the Samba service with:

sudo systemctl enable --now smbd
How to configure Samba
Before we configure Samba, let’s find out what our LAN network interface is with the command:

ip a
Locate the NIC associated with your LAN address, which will be something like ens5. Open the Samba configuration file with:

sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
Locate the line:

; interfaces = 127.0.0.0/8 eth0
Change that to:

interfaces = 127.0.0.0/8 IFACE
Where IFACE is the interface name.

To make sure Samba is only listening to that interface locate the below line:

; bind interfaces only = yes
Change that line to:

bind interfaces only = yes
Next, at the bottom of this file, we’re going to create the new public share with the following:

[public]
path = /home/share
public = yes
guest only = yes
writable = yes
force create mode = 0666
force directory mode = 0777
browseable = yes
Save and close the file.

How to create the shared directory
Next, we’re must create a directory to house the shares. Back at the terminal, create the directory with:

sudo mkdir /home/share
Now, we’ll give it the necessary permissions with:

sudo chmod -R ugo+w /home/share
Restart Samba with:

sudo systemctl restart smbd
